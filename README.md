# Rule Engine with AST By Sarang Padulkar

This is a web application that allows users to create and manage rules using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The rules are evaluated against user attributes like age, department, income, etc., to determine eligibility. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, and Mongoose. The frontend uses React.js, Vite, tailwind CSS.
