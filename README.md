# Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates By Sarang Padulkar.
The Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring is a web-based application that collects, processes, and displays live weather data from various sensors. Designed for efficiency and accuracy, this system leverages MongoDBâ€™s aggregation and rollup functionalities to store historical data and perform complex real-time calculations. The project aims to provide users with up-to-date information, while also allowing in-depth analysis of weather patterns over time.
